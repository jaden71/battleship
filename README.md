# Battleship Multiplayer in Java

##What we need to do:
  - [x] Learn Graphics and Networking in Java
  - [x] Write simple Battleship code.
  - [x] Implement networking into program. (!)
  - [ ] Debug.
  - [ ] Finish.

###UPDATE
No more networking (?). We need to work on singleplayer and local multiplayer.

What should the special thing be?
  1. Hail Mary attack, once per game.
  2. Wide strike attack, charge up for 3 turns
  3. Condensed Hail mary attack, once per game (Hail Mary, but you click and the shots land close to where you click)
  4. ?
